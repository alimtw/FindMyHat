Assessment On JavaScript on FindMyHat
●	What did you like about this project?
  A real experience to think about the logic on the user requirement and to use JavaScript to transform it. 
●	What did you struggle with in this project?
  The JavaScript especially on the movement of the character "*". The concept is setup by increasing the position but just could not have it being added the position. Comment off some script to avoid any issues when running the system
●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
  There will be alot of practice on different situation and also understanding more on JavaScript capability. The quick learn and quick apply are very difficult but it does give a good knowledge on it.
